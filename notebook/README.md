# Demo Jupyter Notebook

This notebook just serves as a quick demo visualizing the geo search capabilities.
Originally I planned to create a small frontend but decided against it in order to move to my next project faster.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- python3
- pip3
- make

To set up the python environment with the required dependencies just run `make setup`.
The command will create a virtual environment, activate it and install all dependencies.
To start the jupyter notebook, just rum `make start` and open the notebook on the gven URL.
